In this repo we have three files html,css and javascript.

``` For the requirements we have two features in this.

We have files at the top for entering year which user want the date prior to current date.If user enter year 18 in year field then press left arraw key then the calendar shows the that year prior date.

And the other one feature is that if user did not enter any year number in 'Enter Year' field and press left arrow and right arrow key will work with default feature of calendar.
